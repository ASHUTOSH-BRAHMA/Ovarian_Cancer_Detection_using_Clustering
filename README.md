# Ovarian_Cancer_Detection_using_Clustering
A deep learning pipeline using DenseNet121 and K-Means to classify ovarian cancer images without labels. Features are extracted, clustered into pseudo-classes, and used to train and fine-tune a classifier with callbacks for stability. Final models are saved for deployment in medical imaging tasks.
